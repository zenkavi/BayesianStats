Stan on a cluster pipeline notes

Data prepation R script
Model text file
Model compilation and running R script
Model output processing script
Batch script parallelizing the model fit step

What should the architecture be like based on modelComparison.Rmd?

From https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/reduce_sum_tutorial.html
"If a model has a large number of arguments that are either defined in the parameters block, transformed parameters block, or model block, or do not do very much computation inside the reduce function, or does not get lucky with caching, the speedup will be much more limited."
